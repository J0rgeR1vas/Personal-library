            “Take these,” said the old man, holding out a white stone and a
            black stone that had been embedded at the center of the
            breastplate. “They are called Urim and Thummim. The black
            signifies ‘yes,’ and the white ‘no.’ When you are unable to read the
            omens, they will help you to do so. Always ask an objective
            question.
            “But, if you can, try to make your own decisions. The treasure is
            at the Pyramids; that you already knew. But I had to insist on the
            payment of six sheep because I helped you to make your decision.”
            The boy put the stones in his pouch. From then on, he would
            make his own decisions.
            “Don’t forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and
            nothing else. And don’t forget the language of omens. And, above all,
            don’t forget to follow your Personal Legend through to its
            conclusion.
            “But before I go, I want to tell you a little story.
            “A certain shopkeeper sent his son to learn about the secret of
            happiness from the wisest man in the world. The lad wandered
            through the desert for forty days, and finally came upon a beautiful
            castle, high atop a mountain. It was there that the wise man lived.
            “Rather than finding a saintly man, though, our hero, on entering
            the main room of the castle, saw a hive of activity: tradesmen came
            and went, people were conversing in the corners, a small orchestra
            was playing soft music, and there was a table covered with platters
            of the most delicious food in that part of the world. The wise man
            conversed with everyone, and the boy had to wait for two hours
            before it was his turn to be given the man’s attention.
            “The wise man listened attentively to the boy’s explanation of
            why he had come, but told him that he didn’t have time just then to
            explain the secret of happiness. He suggested that the boy look
            around the palace and return in two hours.
            “‘Meanwhile, I want to ask you to do something,’ said the wise
            man, handing the boy a teaspoon that held two drops of oil. ‘As you
            wander around, carry this spoon with you without allowing the oil
            to spill.’
            “The boy began climbing and descending the many stairways of
            the palace, keeping his eyes fixed on the spoon. After two hours, he
            returned to the room where the wise man was.
            “‘Well,’ asked the wise man, ‘did you see the Persian tapestries
            that are hanging in my dining hall? Did you see the garden that it
            took the master gardener ten years to create? Did you notice the
            beautiful parchments in my library?’
            “The boy was embarrassed, and confessed that he had observed
            nothing. His only concern had been not to spill the oil that the wise
            man had entrusted to him.
            “‘Then go back and observe the marvels of my world,’ said the
            wise man. ‘You cannot trust a man if you don’t know his house.’
            “Relieved, the boy picked up the spoon and returned to his
            exploration of the palace, this time observing all of the works of art
            on the ceilings and the walls. He saw the gardens, the mountains all
            around him, the beauty of the flowers, and the taste with which
            everything had been selected. Upon returning to the wise man, he
            related in detail everything he had seen.
            “‘But where are the drops of oil I entrusted to you?’ asked the
            wise man.
            “Looking down at the spoon he held, the boy saw that the oil was
            gone.
