“Drink and enjoy yourself,” said the alchemist, noticing that the
boy was feeling happier. “Rest well tonight, as if you were a warrior
preparing for combat. Remember that wherever your heart is, there
you will find your treasure. You’ve got to find the treasure, so that
everything you have learned along the way can make sense.
“Tomorrow, sell your camel and buy a horse. Camels are
traitorous: they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire.
Then suddenly, they kneel and die. But horses tire bit by bit. You
always know how much you can ask of them, and when it is that
they are about to die.”
THE FOLLOWING NIGHT, THE BOY APPEARED AT THE alchemist’s tent with a
horse. The alchemist was ready, and he mounted his own steed and
placed the falcon on his left shoulder. He said to the boy, “Show me
where there is life out in the desert. Only those who can see such
signs of life are able to find treasure.”
They began to ride out over the sands, with the moon lighting
their way. I don’t know if I’ll be able to find life in the desert, the boy
thought. I don’t know the desert that well yet.
He wanted to say so to the alchemist, but he was afraid of the
man. They reached the rocky place where the boy had seen the
hawks in the sky, but now there was only silence and the wind.
“I don’t know how to find life in the desert,” the boy said. “I
know that there is life here, but I don’t know where to look.”
“Life attracts life,” the alchemist answered.
And then the boy understood. He loosened the reins on his
horse, who galloped forward over the rocks and sand. The alchemist
followed as the boy’s horse ran for almost half an hour. They could
no longer see the palms of the oasis—only the gigantic moon above
them, and its silver reflections from the stones of the desert.
Suddenly, for no apparent reason, the boy’s horse began to slow.
“There’s life here,” the boy said to the alchemist. “I don’t know
the language of the desert, but my horse knows the language of life.”
They dismounted, and the alchemist said nothing. Advancing
slowly, they searched among the stones. The alchemist stopped
abruptly, and bent to the ground. There was a hole there among the
stones. The alchemist put his hand into the hole, and then his entire
arm, up to his shoulder. Something was moving there, and the
alchemist’s eyes—the boy could see only his eyes—squinted with
his effort. His arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the
hole. Then, with a motion that startled the boy, he withdrew his arm
and leaped to his feet. In his hand, he grasped a snake by the tail.
The boy leapt as well, but away from the alchemist. The snake
fought frantically, making hissing sounds that shattered the silence
of the desert. It was a cobra, whose venom could kill a person in
minutes.
“Watch out for his venom,” the boy said. But even though the
alchemist had put his hand in the hole, and had surely already been
bitten, his expression was calm. “The alchemist is two hundred
years old,” the Englishman had told him. He must know how to deal
with the snakes of the desert.
The boy watched as his companion went to his horse and
withdrew a scimitar. With its blade, he drew a circle in the sand, and
then he placed the snake within it. The serpent relaxed immediately.
“Not to worry,” said the alchemist. “He won’t leave the circle.
You found life in the desert, the omen that I needed.”
“Why was that so important?”
“Because the Pyramids are surrounded by the desert.”
The boy didn’t want to talk about the Pyramids. His heart was
heavy, and he had been melancholy since the previous night. To
continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon
Fatima.
“I’m going to guide you across the desert,” the alchemist said.
“I want to stay at the oasis,” the boy answered. “I’ve found
Fatima, and, as far as I’m concerned, she’s worth more than
treasure.”
“Fatima is a woman of the desert,” said the alchemist. “She
knows that men have to go away in order to return. And she already
has her treasure: it’s you. Now she expects that you will find what it
is you’re looking for.”
