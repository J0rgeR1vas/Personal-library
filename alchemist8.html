          “No one can be from many places,” the boy said. “I’m a shepherd,
            and I have been to many places, but I come from only one place—
            from a city near an ancient castle. That’s where I was born.”
            “Well then, we could say that I was born in Salem.”
            The boy didn’t know where Salem was, but he didn’t want to ask,
            fearing that he would appear ignorant. He looked at the people in
            the plaza for a while; they were coming and going, and all of them
            seemed to be very busy.
            “So, what is Salem like?” he asked, trying to get some sort of clue.
            “It’s like it always has been.”
            No clue yet. But he knew that Salem wasn’t in Andalusia. If it
            were, he would already have heard of it.
            “And what do you do in Salem?” he insisted.
            “What do I do in Salem?” The old man laughed. “Well, I’m the
            king of Salem!”
            People say strange things, the boy thought. Sometimes it’s better
            to be with the sheep, who don’t say anything. And better still to be
            alone with one’s books. They tell their incredible stories at the time
            when you want to hear them. But when you’re talking to people,
            they say some things that are so strange that you don’t know how to
            continue the conversation.
            “My name is Melchizedek,” said the old man. “How many sheep
            do you have?”
            “Enough,” said the boy. He could see that the old man wanted to
            know more about his life.
            “Well, then, we’ve got a problem. I can’t help you if you feel
            you’ve got enough sheep.”
            The boy was getting irritated. He wasn’t asking for help. It was
            the old man who had asked for a drink of his wine, and had started
            the conversation.
            “Give me my book,” the boy said. “I have to go and gather my
            sheep and get going.”
            “Give me one-tenth of your sheep,” said the old man, “and I’ll tell
            you how to find the hidden treasure.”
            The boy remembered his dream, and suddenly everything was
            clear to him. The old woman hadn’t charged him anything, but the
            old man—maybe he was her husband—was going to find a way to
            get much more money in exchange for information about something
            that didn’t even exist. The old man was probably a Gypsy, too.
            But before the boy could say anything, the old man leaned over,
            picked up a stick, and began to write in the sand of the plaza.
            Something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that
            the boy was momentarily blinded. With a movement that was too
            quick for someone his age, the man covered whatever it was with
            his cape. When his vision returned to normal, the boy was able to
            read what the old man had written in the sand.
            There, in the sand of the plaza of that small city, the boy read the
            names of his father and his mother and the name of the seminary he
            had attended. He read the name of the merchant’s daughter, which
            he hadn’t even known, and he read things he had never told anyone.
            “I’M THE KING OF SALEM,” THE OLD MAN HAD SAID.
            “Why would a king be talking with a shepherd?” the boy asked,
            awed and embarrassed.
