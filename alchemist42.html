          So the tribesmen lived only for the present,
because the present was full of surprises, and they had to be aware
of many things: Where was the enemy’s sword? Where was his
horse? What kind of blow should one deliver next in order to
remain alive? The camel driver was not a fighter, and he had
consulted with seers. Many of them had been right about what they
said, while some had been wrong. Then, one day, the oldest seer he
had ever sought out (and the one most to be feared) had asked why
the camel driver was so interested in the future.
“Well…so I can do things,” he had responded. “And so I can
change those things that I don’t want to happen.”
“But then they wouldn’t be a part of your future,” the seer had
said.
“Well, maybe I just want to know the future so I can prepare
myself for what’s coming.”
“If good things are coming, they will be a pleasant surprise,” said
the seer. “If bad things are, and you know in advance, you will suffer
greatly before they even occur.”
“I want to know about the future because I’m a man,” the camel
driver had said to the seer. “And men always live their lives based
on the future.”
The seer was a specialist in the casting of twigs; he threw them
on the ground, and made interpretations based on how they fell.
That day, he didn’t make a cast. He wrapped the twigs in a piece of
cloth and put them back in his bag.
“I make my living forecasting the future for people,” he said. “I
know the science of the twigs, and I know how to use them to
penetrate to the place where all is written. There, I can read the
past, discover what has already been forgotten, and understand the
omens that are here in the present.
“When people consult me, it’s not that I’m reading the future; I
am guessing at the future. The future belongs to God, and it is only
he who reveals it, under extraordinary circumstances. How do I
guess at the future? Based on the omens of the present. The secret is
here in the present. If you pay attention to the present, you can
improve upon it. And, if you improve on the present, what comes
later will also be better. Forget about the future, and live each day
according to the teachings, confident that God loves his children.
Each day, in itself, brings with it an eternity.”
The camel driver had asked what the circumstances were under
which God would allow him to see the future.
“Only when he, himself, reveals it. And God only rarely reveals
the future. When he does so, it is for only one reason: it’s a future
that was written so as to be altered.”
God had shown the boy a part of the future, the camel driver
thought. Why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his
instrument?
“Go and speak to the tribal chieftains,” said the camel driver.
“Tell them about the armies that are approaching.”
“They’ll laugh at me.”
