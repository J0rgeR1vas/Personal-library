          He had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his
father, fruitlessly seeking the Philosopher’s Stone. He had spent
enormous amounts of time at the great libraries of the world, and
had purchased all the rarest and most important volumes on
alchemy. In one he had read that, many years ago, a famous Arabian
alchemist had visited Europe. It was said that he was more than two
hundred years old, and that he had discovered the Philosopher’s
Stone and the Elixir of Life. The Englishman had been profoundly
impressed by the story. But he would never have thought it more
than just a myth, had not a friend of his—returning from an
archaeological expedition in the desert—told him about an Arab
that was possessed of exceptional powers.
“He lives at the Al-Fayoum oasis,” his friend had said. “And
people say that he is two hundred years old, and is able to
transform any metal into gold.”
The Englishman could not contain his excitement. He canceled
all his commitments and pulled together the most important of his
books, and now here he was, sitting inside a dusty, smelly
warehouse. Outside, a huge caravan was being prepared for a
crossing of the Sahara, and was scheduled to pass through AlFayoum.
I’m going to find that damned alchemist, the Englishman
thought. And the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable.
A young Arab, also loaded down with baggage, entered, and
greeted the Englishman.
“Where are you bound?” asked the young Arab.
“I’m going into the desert,” the man answered, turning back to
his reading. He didn’t want any conversation at this point. What he
needed to do was review all he had learned over the years, because
the alchemist would certainly put him to the test.
The young Arab took out a book and began to read. The book
was written in Spanish. That’s good, thought the Englishman. He
spoke Spanish better than Arabic, and, if this boy was going to AlFayoum, there would be someone to talk to when there were no
other important things to do.
“THAT’S STRANGE,” SAID THE BOY, AS HE TRIED ONCE again to read the
burial scene that began the book. “I’ve been trying for two years to
read this book, and I never get past these first few pages.” Even
without a king to provide an interruption, he was unable to
concentrate.
He still had some doubts about the decision he had made. But he
was able to understand one thing: making a decision was only the
beginning of things. When someone makes a decision, he is really
diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had
never dreamed of when he first made the decision.
When I decided to seek out my treasure, I never imagined that
I’d wind up working in a crystal shop, he thought. And joining this
caravan may have been my decision, but where it goes is going to be
a mystery to me.
Nearby was the Englishman, reading a book. He seemed
unfriendly, and had looked irritated when the boy had entered.
They might even have become friends, but the Englishman closed
off the conversation.
