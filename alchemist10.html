          “Because you are trying to realize your Personal Legend. And
            you are at the point where you’re about to give it all up.”
            “And that’s when you always appear on the scene?”
            “Not always in this way, but I always appear in one form or
            another. Sometimes I appear in the form of a solution, or a good
            idea. At other times, at a crucial moment, I make it easier for things
            to happen. There are other things I do, too, but most of the time
            people don’t realize I’ve done them.”
            The old man related that, the week before, he had been forced to
            appear before a miner, and had taken the form of a stone. The miner
            had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds. For five years
            he had been working a certain river, and had examined hundreds of
            thousands of stones looking for an emerald. The miner was about to
            give it all up, right at the point when, if he were to examine just one
            more stone—just one more—he would find his emerald. Since the
            miner had sacrificed everything to his Personal Legend, the old man
            decided to become involved. He transformed himself into a stone
            that rolled up to the miner’s foot. The miner, with all the anger and
            frustration of his five fruitless years, picked up the stone and threw
            it aside. But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone
            it fell upon, and there, embedded in the broken stone, was the most
            beautiful emerald in the world.
            “People learn, early in their lives, what is their reason for being,”
            said the old man, with a certain bitterness. “Maybe that’s why they
            give up on it so early, too. But that’s the way it is.”
            The boy reminded the old man that he had said something about
            hidden treasure.
            “Treasure is uncovered by the force of flowing water, and it is
            buried by the same currents,” said the old man. “If you want to learn
            about your own treasure, you will have to give me one-tenth of your
            flock.”
            “What about one-tenth of my treasure?”
            The old man looked disappointed. “If you start out by promising
            what you don’t even have yet, you’ll lose your desire to work
            toward getting it.”
            The boy told him that he had already promised to give one-tenth
            of his treasure to the Gypsy.
            “Gypsies are experts at getting people to do that,” sighed the old
            man. “In any case, it’s good that you’ve learned that everything in
            life has its price. This is what the Warriors of the Light try to teach.”
            The old man returned the book to the boy.
            “Tomorrow, at this same time, bring me a tenth of your flock.
            And I will tell you how to find the hidden treasure. Good afternoon.”
            And he vanished around the corner of the plaza.
            THE BOY BEGAN AGAIN TO READ HIS BOOK, BUT HE WAS NO longer able to
            concentrate. He was tense and upset, because he knew that the old
            man was right. He went over to the bakery and bought a loaf of
            bread, thinking about whether or not he should tell the baker what
            the old man had said about him. Sometimes it’s better to leave
            things as they are, he thought to himself, and decided to say nothing.
            If he were to say anything, the baker would spend three days
            thinking about giving it all up, even though he had gotten used to
            the way things were. The boy could certainly resist causing that
            kind of anxiety for the baker. So he began to wander through the
            city, and found himself at the gates. There was a small building
            there, with a window at which people bought tickets to Africa. And
            he knew that Egypt was in Africa.
