          And they had understood each other perfectly well.
            There must be a language that doesn’t depend on words, the boy
            thought. I’ve already had that experience with my sheep, and now
            it’s happening with people.
            He was learning a lot of new things. Some of them were things
            that he had already experienced, and weren’t really new, but that he
            had never perceived before. And he hadn’t perceived them because
            he had become accustomed to them. He realized: If I can learn to
            understand this language without words, I can learn to understand
            the world.
            Relaxed and unhurried, he resolved that he would walk through
            the narrow streets of Tangier. Only in that way would he be able to
            read the omens. He knew it would require a lot of patience, but
            shepherds know all about patience. Once again he saw that, in that
            strange land, he was applying the same lessons he had learned with
            his sheep.
            “All things are one,” the old man had said.
            THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT AWOKE WITH THE DAY, AND FELT the same anxiety
            that he felt every morning. He had been in the same place for thirty
            years: a shop at the top of a hilly street where few customers
            passed. Now it was too late to change anything—the only thing he
            had ever learned to do was to buy and sell crystal glassware. There
            had been a time when many people knew of his shop: Arab
            merchants, French and English geologists, German soldiers who
            were always well-heeled. In those days it had been wonderful to be
            selling crystal, and he had thought how he would become rich, and
            have beautiful women at his side as he grew older.
            But, as time passed, Tangier had changed. The nearby city of
            Ceuta had grown faster than Tangier, and business had fallen off.
            Neighbors moved away, and there remained only a few small shops
            on the hill. And no one was going to climb the hill just to browse
            through a few small shops.
            But the crystal merchant had no choice. He had lived thirty years
            of his life buying and selling crystal pieces, and now it was too late
            to do anything else.
            He spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings
            and goings in the street. He had done this for years, and knew the
            schedule of everyone who passed. But, just before lunchtime, a boy
            stopped in front of the shop. He was dressed normally, but the
            practiced eyes of the crystal merchant could see that the boy had no
            money to spend. Nevertheless, the merchant decided to delay his
            lunch for a few minutes until the boy moved on.
            A CARD HANGING IN THE DOORWAY ANNOUNCED THAT several languages
            were spoken in the shop. The boy saw a man appear behind the
            counter.
            “I can clean up those glasses in the window, if you want,” said
            the boy. “The way they look now, nobody is going to want to buy
            them.”
            The man looked at him without responding.
            “In exchange, you could give me something to eat.”
            The man still said nothing, and the boy sensed that he was going
            to have to make a decision. In his pouch, he had his jacket—he
            certainly wasn’t going to need it in the desert. Taking the jacket out,
            he began to clean the glasses. In half an hour, he had cleaned all the
            glasses in the window, and, as he was doing so, two customers had
            entered the shop and bought some crystal.
            When he had completed the cleaning, he asked the man for
            something to eat. “Let’s go and have some lunch,” said the crystal
            merchant.
