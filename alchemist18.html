          He stuck his hand into the pouch, and felt around for one of the
            stones. As he did so, both of them pushed through a hole in the
            pouch and fell to the ground. The boy had never even noticed that
            there was a hole in his pouch. He knelt down to find Urim and
            Thummim and put them back in the pouch. But as he saw them lying
            there on the ground, another phrase came to his mind.
            “Learn to recognize omens, and follow them,” the old king had
            said.
            An omen. The boy smiled to himself. He picked up the two
            stones and put them back in his pouch. He didn’t consider mending
            the hole—the stones could fall through any time they wanted. He
            had learned that there were certain things one shouldn’t ask about,
            so as not to flee from one’s own Personal Legend. “I promised that I
            would make my own decisions,” he said to himself.
            But the stones had told him that the old man was still with him,
            and that made him feel more confident. He looked around at the
            empty plaza again, feeling less desperate than before. This wasn’t a
            strange place; it was a new one.
            After all, what he had always wanted was just that: to know new
            places. Even if he never got to the Pyramids, he had already traveled
            farther than any shepherd he knew. Oh, if they only knew how
            different things are just two hours by ship from where they are, he
            thought. Although his new world at the moment was just an empty
            marketplace, he had already seen it when it was teeming with life,
            and he would never forget it. He remembered the sword. It hurt him
            a bit to think about it, but he had never seen one like it before. As he
            mused about these things, he realized that he had to choose
            between thinking of himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an
            adventurer in quest of his treasure.
            “I’m an adventurer, looking for treasure,” he said to himself.
            HE WAS SHAKEN INTO WAKEFULNESS BY SOMEONE. HE had fallen asleep in
            the middle of the marketplace, and life in the plaza was about to
            resume.
            Looking around, he sought his sheep, and then realized that he
            was in a new world. But instead of being saddened, he was happy.
            He no longer had to seek out food and water for the sheep; he could
            go in search of his treasure, instead. He had not a cent in his pocket,
            but he had faith. He had decided, the night before, that he would be
            as much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books.
            He walked slowly through the market. The merchants were
            assembling their stalls, and the boy helped a candy seller to do his.
            The candy seller had a smile on his face: he was happy, aware of
            what his life was about, and ready to begin a day’s work. His smile
            reminded the boy of the old man—the mysterious old king he had
            met. “This candy merchant isn’t making candy so that later he can
            travel or marry a shopkeeper’s daughter. He’s doing it because it’s
            what he wants to do,” thought the boy. He realized that he could do
            the same thing the old man had done—sense whether a person was
            near to or far from his Personal Legend. Just by looking at them. It’s
            easy, and yet I’ve never done it before, he thought.
            When the stall was assembled, the candy seller offered the boy
            the first sweet he had made for the day. The boy thanked him, ate it,
            and went on his way. When he had gone only a short distance, he
            realized that, while they were erecting the stall, one of them had
            spoken Arabic and the other Spanish.
