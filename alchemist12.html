           I left my father, my mother, and the town castle behind. They
            have gotten used to my being away, and so have I. The sheep will get
            used to my not being there, too, the boy thought.
            From where he sat, he could observe the plaza. People continued
            to come and go from the baker’s shop. A young couple sat on the
            bench where he had talked with the old man, and they kissed.
            “That baker…” he said to himself, without completing the
            thought. The levanter was still getting stronger, and he felt its force
            on his face. That wind had brought the Moors, yes, but it had also
            brought the smell of the desert and of veiled women. It had brought
            with it the sweat and the dreams of men who had once left to search
            for the unknown, and for gold and adventure—and for the
            Pyramids. The boy felt jealous of the freedom of the wind, and saw
            that he could have the same freedom. There was nothing to hold
            him back except himself. The sheep, the merchant’s daughter, and
            the fields of Andalusia were only steps along the way to his Personal
            Legend.
            The next day, the boy met the old man at noon. He brought six
            sheep with him.
            “I’m surprised,” the boy said. “My friend bought all the other
            sheep immediately. He said that he had always dreamed of being a
            shepherd, and that it was a good omen.”
            “That’s the way it always is,” said the old man. “It’s called the
            principle of favorability. When you play cards the first time, you are
            almost sure to win. Beginner’s luck.”
            “Why is that?”
            “Because there is a force that wants you to realize your Personal
            Legend; it whets your appetite with a taste of success.”
            Then the old man began to inspect the sheep, and he saw that
            one was lame. The boy explained that it wasn’t important, since that
            sheep was the most intelligent of the flock, and produced the most
            wool.
            “Where is the treasure?” he asked.
            “It’s in Egypt, near the Pyramids.”
            The boy was startled. The old woman had said the same thing.
            But she hadn’t charged him anything.
            “In order to find the treasure, you will have to follow the omens.
            God has prepared a path for everyone to follow. You just have to
            read the omens that he left for you.”
            Before the boy could reply, a butterfly appeared and fluttered
            between him and the old man. He remembered something his
            grandfather had once told him: that butterflies were a good omen.
            Like crickets, and like grasshoppers; like lizards and four-leaf
            clovers.
            “That’s right,” said the old man, able to read the boy’s thoughts.
            “Just as your grandfather taught you. These are good omens.”
            The old man opened his cape, and the boy was struck by what he
            saw. The old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold, covered with
            precious stones. The boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on
            the previous day.
            He really was a king! He must be disguised to avoid encounters
            with thieves.
