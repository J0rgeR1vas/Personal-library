          “It’s the oasis,” said the camel driver.
“Well, why don’t we go there right now?” the boy asked.
“Because we have to sleep.”
THE BOY AWOKE AS THE SUN ROSE. THERE, IN FRONT OF him, where the
small stars had been the night before, was an endless row of date
palms, stretching across the entire desert.
“We’ve done it!” said the Englishman, who had also awakened
early.
But the boy was quiet. He was at home with the silence of the
desert, and he was content just to look at the trees. He still had a
long way to go to reach the Pyramids, and someday this morning
would just be a memory. But this was the present moment—the
party the camel driver had mentioned—and he wanted to live it as
he did the lessons of his past and his dreams of the future. Although
the vision of the date palms would someday be just a memory, right
now it signified shade, water, and a refuge from the war. Yesterday,
the camel’s groan signaled danger, and now a row of date palms
could herald a miracle.
The world speaks many languages, the boy thought.
THE TIMES RUSH PAST, AND SO DO THE CARAVANS, thought the alchemist,
as he watched the hundreds of people and animals arriving at the
oasis. People were shouting at the new arrivals, dust obscured the
desert sun, and the children of the oasis were bursting with
excitement at the arrival of the strangers. The alchemist saw the
tribal chiefs greet the leader of the caravan, and converse with him
at length.
But none of that mattered to the alchemist. He had already seen
many people come and go, and the desert remained as it was. He
had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands. The dunes
were changed constantly by the wind, yet these were the same
sands he had known since he was a child. He always enjoyed seeing
the happiness that the travelers experienced when, after weeks of
yellow sand and blue sky, they first saw the green of the date palms.
Maybe God created the desert so that man could appreciate the date
trees, he thought.
He decided to concentrate on more practical matters. He knew
that in the caravan there was a man to whom he was to teach some
of his secrets. The omens had told him so. He didn’t know the man
yet, but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared.
He hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous
apprentice.
I don’t know why these things have to be transmitted by word of
mouth, he thought. It wasn’t exactly that they were secrets; God
revealed his secrets easily to all his creatures.
He had only one explanation for this fact: things have to be
transmitted this way because they were made up from the pure life,
and this kind of life cannot be captured in pictures or words.
Because people become fascinated with pictures and words, and
wind up forgetting the Language of the World.
THE BOY COULDN’T BELIEVE WHAT HE WAS SEEING: THE oasis, rather than
being just a well surrounded by a few palm trees—as he had seen
once in a geography book—was much larger than many towns back
in Spain. There were three hundred wells, fifty thousand date trees,
and innumerable colored tents spread among them.
