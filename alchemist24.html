          “You must always know what it is that you want,” the old king
had said. The boy knew, and was now working toward it. Maybe it
was his treasure to have wound up in that strange land, met up with
a thief, and doubled the size of his flock without spending a cent.
He was proud of himself. He had learned some important things,
like how to deal in crystal, and about the language without
words…and about omens. One afternoon he had seen a man at the
top of the hill, complaining that it was impossible to find a decent
place to get something to drink after such a climb. The boy,
accustomed to recognizing omens, spoke to the merchant.
“Let’s sell tea to the people who climb the hill.”
“Lots of places sell tea around here,” the merchant said.
“But we could sell tea in crystal glasses. The people will enjoy
the tea and want to buy the glasses. I have been told that beauty is
the great seducer of men.”
The merchant didn’t respond, but that afternoon, after saying his
prayers and closing the shop, he invited the boy to sit with him and
share his hookah, that strange pipe used by the Arabs.
“What is it you’re looking for?” asked the old merchant.
“I’ve already told you. I need to buy my sheep back, so I have to
earn the money to do so.”
The merchant put some new coals in the hookah, and inhaled
deeply.
“I’ve had this shop for thirty years. I know good crystal from bad,
and everything else there is to know about crystal. I know its
dimensions and how it behaves. If we serve tea in crystal, the shop
is going to expand. And then I’ll have to change my way of life.”
“Well, isn’t that good?”
“I’m already used to the way things are. Before you came, I was
thinking about how much time I had wasted in the same place, while
my friends had moved on, and either went bankrupt or did better
than they had before. It made me very depressed. Now, I can see
that it hasn’t been too bad. The shop is exactly the size I always
wanted it to be. I don’t want to change anything, because I don’t
know how to deal with change. I’m used to the way I am.”
The boy didn’t know what to say. The old man continued, “You
have been a real blessing to me. Today, I understand something I
didn’t see before: every blessing ignored becomes a curse. I don’t
want anything else in life. But you are forcing me to look at wealth
and at horizons I have never known. Now that I have seen them, and
now that I see how immense my possibilities are, I’m going to feel
worse than I did before you arrived. Because I know the things I
should be able to accomplish, and I don’t want to do so.”
It’s good I refrained from saying anything to the baker in Tarifa,
thought the boy to himself.
They went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to
set. They were conversing in Arabic, and the boy was proud of
himself for being able to do so. There had been a time when he
thought that his sheep could teach him everything he needed to
know about the world. But they could never have taught him Arabic.
There are probably other things in the world that the sheep can’t
teach me, thought the boy as he regarded the old merchant. All they
ever do, really, is look for food and water. And maybe it wasn’t that
they were teaching me, but that I was learning from them.
“Maktub,” the merchant said, finally.
“What does that mean?”
“You would have to have been born an Arab to understand,” he
answered. “But in your language it would be something like ‘It is
written.’”
