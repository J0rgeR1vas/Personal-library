          “Can I help you?” asked the man behind the window.
            “Maybe tomorrow,” said the boy, moving away. If he sold just
            one of his sheep, he’d have enough to get to the other shore of the
            strait. The idea frightened him.
            “Another dreamer,” said the ticket seller to his assistant,
            watching the boy walk away. “He doesn’t have enough money to
            travel.”
            While standing at the ticket window, the boy had remembered
            his flock, and decided he should go back to being a shepherd. In two
            years he had learned everything about shepherding: he knew how
            to shear sheep, how to care for pregnant ewes, and how to protect
            the sheep from wolves. He knew all the fields and pastures of
            Andalusia. And he knew what was the fair price for every one of his
            animals.
            He decided to return to his friend’s stable by the longest route
            possible. As he walked past the city’s castle, he interrupted his
            return, and climbed the stone ramp that led to the top of the wall.
            From there, he could see Africa in the distance. Someone had once
            told him that it was from there that the Moors had come, to occupy
            all of Spain.
            He could see almost the entire city from where he sat, including
            the plaza where he had talked with the old man. Curse the moment I
            met that old man, he thought. He had come to the town only to find
            a woman who could interpret his dream. Neither the woman nor the
            old man was at all impressed by the fact that he was a shepherd.
            They were solitary individuals who no longer believed in things,
            and didn’t understand that shepherds become attached to their
            sheep. He knew everything about each member of his flock: he
            knew which ones were lame, which one was to give birth two
            months from now, and which were the laziest. He knew how to
            shear them, and how to slaughter them. If he ever decided to leave
            them, they would suffer.
            The wind began to pick up. He knew that wind: people called it
            the levanter, because on it the Moors had come from the Levant at
            the eastern end of the Mediterranean.
            The levanter increased in intensity. Here I am, between my flock
            and my treasure, the boy thought. He had to choose between
            something he had become accustomed to and something he wanted
            to have. There was also the merchant’s daughter, but she wasn’t as
            important as his flock, because she didn’t depend on him. Maybe she
            didn’t even remember him. He was sure that it made no difference
            to her on which day he appeared: for her, every day was the same,
            and when each day is the same as the next, it’s because people fail to
            recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that
            the sun rises.
