          And, as he smothered the coals in the hookah, he told the boy
that he could begin to sell tea in the crystal glasses. Sometimes,
there’s just no way to hold back the river.
THE MEN CLIMBED THE HILL, AND THEY WERE TIRED when they reached
the top. But there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing
mint tea. They went in to drink the tea, which was served in
beautiful crystal glasses.
“My wife never thought of this,” said one, and he bought some
crystal—he was entertaining guests that night, and the guests
would be impressed by the beauty of the glassware. The other man
remarked that tea was always more delicious when it was served in
crystal, because the aroma was retained. The third said that it was a
tradition in the Orient to use crystal glasses for tea because it had
magical powers.
Before long, the news spread, and a great many people began to
climb the hill to see the shop that was doing something new in a
trade that was so old. Other shops were opened that served tea in
crystal, but they weren’t at the top of a hill, and they had little
business.
Eventually, the merchant had to hire two more employees. He
began to import enormous quantities of tea, along with his crystal,
and his shop was sought out by men and women with a thirst for
things new.
And, in that way, the months passed.
THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN. IT HAD BEEN ELEVEN months and nine
days since he had first set foot on the African continent.
He dressed in his Arabian clothing of white linen, bought
especially for this day. He put his headcloth in place and secured it
with a ring made of camel skin. Wearing his new sandals, he
descended the stairs silently.
The city was still sleeping. He prepared himself a sandwich and
drank some hot tea from a crystal glass. Then he sat in the sun-filled
doorway, smoking the hookah.
He smoked in silence, thinking of nothing, and listening to the
sound of the wind that brought the scent of the desert. When he had
finished his smoke, he reached into one of his pockets, and sat there
for a few moments, regarding what he had withdrawn.
It was a bundle of money. Enough to buy himself a hundred and
twenty sheep, a return ticket, and a license to import products from
Africa into his own country.
He waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the
shop. Then the two went off to have some more tea.
“I’m leaving today,” said the boy. “I have the money I need to buy
my sheep. And you have the money you need to go to Mecca.”
The old man said nothing.
“Will you give me your blessing?” asked the boy. “You have
helped me.” The man continued to prepare his tea, saying nothing.
Then he turned to the boy.
“I am proud of you,” he said. “You brought a new feeling into my
crystal shop. But you know that I’m not going to go to Mecca. Just as
you know that you’re not going to buy your sheep.”
“Who told you that?” asked the boy, startled.
“Maktub,” said the old crystal merchant.
And he gave the boy his blessing.
