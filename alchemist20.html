           He put a sign on the door, and they went to a small café nearby.
            As they sat down at the only table in the place, the crystal merchant
            laughed.
            “You didn’t have to do any cleaning,” he said. “The Koran
            requires me to feed a hungry person.”
            “Well then, why did you let me do it?” the boy asked.
            “Because the crystal was dirty. And both you and I needed to
            cleanse our minds of negative thoughts.”
            When they had eaten, the merchant turned to the boy and said,
            “I’d like you to work in my shop. Two customers came in today
            while you were working, and that’s a good omen.”
            People talk a lot about omens, thought the shepherd. But they
            really don’t know what they’re saying. Just as I hadn’t realized that
            for so many years I had been speaking a language without words to
            my sheep.
            “Do you want to go to work for me?” the merchant asked.
            “I can work for the rest of today,” the boy answered. “I’ll work all
            night, until dawn, and I’ll clean every piece of crystal in your shop.
            In return, I need money to get to Egypt tomorrow.”
            The merchant laughed. “Even if you cleaned my crystal for an
            entire year…even if you earned a good commission selling every
            piece, you would still have to borrow money to get to Egypt. There
            are thousands of kilometers of desert between here and there.”
            There was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the
            city was asleep. No sound from the bazaars, no arguments among
            the merchants, no men climbing to the towers to chant. No hope, no
            adventure, no old kings or Personal Legends, no treasure, and no
            Pyramids. It was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy’s
            soul had. He sat there, staring blankly through the door of the café,
            wishing that he had died, and that everything would end forever at
            that moment.
