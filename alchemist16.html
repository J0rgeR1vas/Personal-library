          The boy was relieved. He got up to pay the bill, but the owner
            grabbed him and began to speak to him in an angry stream of
            words. The boy was strong, and wanted to retaliate, but he was in a
            foreign country. His new friend pushed the owner aside, and pulled
            the boy outside with him. “He wanted your money,” he said.
            “Tangier is not like the rest of Africa. This is a port, and every port
            has its thieves.”
            The boy trusted his new friend. He had helped him out in a
            dangerous situation. He took out his money and counted it.
            “We could get to the Pyramids by tomorrow,” said the other,
            taking the money. “But I have to buy two camels.”
            They walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier.
            Everywhere there were stalls with items for sale. They reached the
            center of a large plaza where the market was held. There were
            thousands of people there, arguing, selling, and buying; vegetables
            for sale amongst daggers, and carpets displayed alongside tobacco.
            But the boy never took his eye off his new friend. After all, he had all
            his money. He thought about asking him to give it back, but decided
            that would be unfriendly. He knew nothing about the customs of the
            strange land he was in.
            “I’ll just watch him,” he said to himself. He knew he was stronger
            than his friend.
            Suddenly, there in the midst of all that confusion, he saw the
            most beautiful sword he had ever seen. The scabbard was embossed
            in silver, and the handle was black and encrusted with precious
            stones. The boy promised himself that, when he returned from
            Egypt, he would buy that sword.
            “Ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs,” he said
            to his friend. Then he realized that he had been distracted for a few
            moments, looking at the sword. His heart squeezed, as if his chest
            had suddenly compressed it. He was afraid to look around, because
            he knew what he would find. He continued to look at the beautiful
            sword for a bit longer, until he summoned the courage to turn
            around.
            All around him was the market, with people coming and going,
            shouting and buying, and the aroma of strange foods…but nowhere
            could he find his new companion.
            The boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become
            separated from him by accident. He decided to stay right there and
            await his return. As he waited, a priest climbed to the top of a
            nearby tower and began his chant; everyone in the market fell to
            their knees, touched their foreheads to the ground, and took up the
            chant. Then, like a colony of worker ants, they dismantled their
            stalls and left.
            The sun began its departure, as well. The boy watched it through
            its trajectory for some time, until it was hidden behind the white
            houses surrounding the plaza. He recalled that when the sun had
            risen that morning, he was on another continent, still a shepherd
            with sixty sheep, and looking forward to meeting with a girl. That
            morning he had known everything that was going to happen to him
            as he walked through the familiar fields. But now, as the sun began
            to set, he was in a different country, a stranger in a strange land,
            where he couldn’t even speak the language. He was no longer a
            shepherd, and he had nothing, not even the money to return and
            start everything over.
