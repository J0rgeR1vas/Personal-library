          THE BOY RODE ALONG THROUGH THE DESERT FOR SEVERAL hours, listening
avidly to what his heart had to say. It was his heart that would tell
him where his treasure was hidden.
“Where your treasure is, there also will be your heart,” the
alchemist had told him.
But his heart was speaking of other things. With pride, it told the
story of a shepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had
on two different occasions. It told of Personal Legend, and of the
many men who had wandered in search of distant lands or beautiful
women, confronting the people of their times with their
preconceived notions. It spoke of journeys, discoveries, books, and
change.
As he was about to climb yet another dune, his heart whispered,
“Be aware of the place where you are brought to tears. That’s where
I am, and that’s where your treasure is.”
The boy climbed the dune slowly. A full moon rose again in the
starry sky: it had been a month since he had set forth from the oasis.
The moonlight cast shadows through the dunes, creating the
appearance of a rolling sea; it reminded the boy of the day when
that horse had reared in the desert, and he had come to know the
alchemist. And the moon fell on the desert’s silence, and on a man’s
journey in search of treasure.
When he reached the top of the dune, his heart leapt. There,
illuminated by the light of the moon and the brightness of the
desert, stood the solemn and majestic Pyramids of Egypt.
The boy fell to his knees and wept. He thanked God for making
him believe in his Personal Legend, and for leading him to meet a
king, a merchant, an Englishman, and an alchemist. And above all
for his having met a woman of the desert who had told him that love
would never keep a man from his Personal Legend.
If he wanted to, he could now return to the oasis, go back to
Fatima, and live his life as a simple shepherd. After all, the alchemist
continued to live in the desert, even though he understood the
Language of the World, and knew how to transform lead into gold.
He didn’t need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone. The
boy told himself that, on the way toward realizing his own Personal
Legend, he had learned all he needed to know, and had experienced
everything he might have dreamed of.
But here he was, at the point of finding his treasure, and he
reminded himself that no project is completed until its objective has
been achieved. The boy looked at the sands around him, and saw
that, where his tears had fallen, a scarab beetle was scuttling
through the sand. During his time in the desert, he had learned that,
in Egypt, the scarab beetles are a symbol of God.
Another omen! The boy began to dig into the dune. As he did so,
he thought of what the crystal merchant had once said: that anyone
could build a pyramid in his backyard. The boy could see now that
he couldn’t do so if he placed stone upon stone for the rest of his life.
Throughout the night, the boy dug at the place he had chosen,
but found nothing. He felt weighted down by the centuries of time
since the Pyramids had been built. But he didn’t stop. He struggled
to continue digging as he fought the wind, which often blew the
sand back into the excavation. His hands were abraded and
exhausted, but he listened to his heart. It had told him to dig where
his tears fell.
As he was attempting to pull out the rocks he encountered, he
heard footsteps. Several figures approached him. Their backs were
to the moonlight, and the boy could see neither their eyes nor their
faces.
“What are you doing here?” one of the figures demanded.
Because he was terrified, the boy didn’t answer. He had found
where his treasure was, and was frightened at what might happen.
“We’re refugees from the tribal wars, and we need money,” the
other figure said. “What are you hiding there?”
“I’m not hiding anything,” the boy answered.
But one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the
hole. Another, who was searching the boy’s bags, found the piece of
gold.
