          “And I know the Soul of the World, because we have talked at
great length to each other during this endless trip through the
universe. It tells me that its greatest problem is that, up until now,
only the minerals and vegetables understand that all things are one.
That there’s no need for iron to be the same as copper, or copper
the same as gold. Each performs its own exact function as a unique
being, and everything would be a symphony of peace if the hand
that wrote all this had stopped on the fifth day of creation.
“But there was a sixth day,” the sun went on.
“You are wise, because you observe everything from a distance,”
the boy said. “But you don’t know about love. If there hadn’t been a
sixth day, man would not exist; copper would always be just copper,
and lead just lead. It’s true that everything has its Personal Legend,
but one day that Personal Legend will be realized. So each thing has
to transform itself into something better, and to acquire a new
Personal Legend, until, someday, the Soul of the World becomes one
thing only.”
The sun thought about that, and decided to shine more brightly.
The wind, which was enjoying the conversation, started to blow
with greater force, so that the sun would not blind the boy.
“This is why alchemy exists,” the boy said. “So that everyone will
search for his treasure, find it, and then want to be better than he
was in his former life. Lead will play its role until the world has no
further need for lead; and then lead will have to turn itself into gold.
“That’s what alchemists do. They show that, when we strive to
become better than we are, everything around us becomes better,
too.”
“Well, why did you say that I don’t know about love?” the sun
asked the boy.
“Because it’s not love to be static like the desert, nor is it love to
roam the world like the wind. And it’s not love to see everything
from a distance, like you do. Love is the force that transforms and
improves the Soul of the World. When I first reached through to it, I
thought the Soul of the World was perfect. But later, I could see that
it was like other aspects of creation, and had its own passions and
wars. It is we who nourish the Soul of the World, and the world we
live in will be either better or worse, depending on whether we
become better or worse. And that’s where the power of love comes
in. Because when we love, we always strive to become better than
we are.”
“So what do you want of me?” the sun asked.
“I want you to help me turn myself into the wind,” the boy
answered.
“Nature knows me as the wisest being in creation,” the sun said.
“But I don’t know how to turn you into the wind.”
“Then, whom should I ask?”
The sun thought for a minute. The wind was listening closely,
and wanted to tell every corner of the world that the sun’s wisdom
had its limitations. That it was unable to deal with this boy who
spoke the Language of the World.
“Speak to the hand that wrote all,” said the sun.
The wind screamed with delight, and blew harder than ever. The
tents were being blown from their ties to the earth, and the animals
were being freed from their tethers. On the cliff, the men clutched at
each other as they sought to keep from being blown away.
The boy turned to the hand that wrote all. As he did so, he
sensed that the universe had fallen silent, and he decided not to
speak.
A current of love rushed from his heart, and the boy began to
pray. It was a prayer that he had never said before, because it was a
prayer without words or pleas. His prayer didn’t give thanks for his
sheep having found new pastures; it didn’t ask that the boy be able
to sell more crystal; and it didn’t beseech that the woman he had
met continue to await his return. In the silence, the boy understood
that the desert, the wind, and the sun were also trying to
understand the signs written by the hand, and were seeking to
follow their paths, and to understand what had been written on a
single emerald. He saw that omens were scattered throughout the
earth and in space, and that there was no reason or significance
attached to their appearance; he could see that not the deserts, nor
the winds, nor the sun, nor people knew why they had been created.
But that the hand had a reason for all of this, and that only the hand
could perform miracles, or transform the sea into a desert…or a
man into the wind. Because only the hand understood that it was a
larger design that had moved the universe to the point at which six
days of creation had evolved into a Master Work.
