          “Should I understand the Emerald Tablet?” the boy asked.
“Perhaps, if you were in a laboratory of alchemy, this would be
the right time to study the best way to understand the Emerald
Tablet. But you are in the desert. So immerse yourself in it. The
desert will give you an understanding of the world; in fact, anything
on the face of the earth will do that. You don’t even have to
understand the desert: all you have to do is contemplate a simple
grain of sand, and you will see in it all the marvels of creation.”
“How do I immerse myself in the desert?”
“Listen to your heart. It knows all things, because it came from
the Soul of the World, and it will one day return there.”
THEY CROSSED THE DESERT FOR ANOTHER TWO DAYS IN silence. The
alchemist had become much more cautious, because they were
approaching the area where the most violent battles were being
waged. As they moved along, the boy tried to listen to his heart.
It was not easy to do; in earlier times, his heart had always been
ready to tell its story, but lately that wasn’t true. There had been
times when his heart spent hours telling of its sadness, and at other
times it became so emotional over the desert sunrise that the boy
had to hide his tears. His heart beat fastest when it spoke to the boy
of treasure, and more slowly when the boy stared entranced at the
endless horizons of the desert. But his heart was never quiet, even
when the boy and the alchemist had fallen into silence.
“Why do we have to listen to our hearts?” the boy asked, when
they had made camp that day.
“Because, wherever your heart is, that is where you’ll find your
treasure.”
“But my heart is agitated,” the boy said. “It has its dreams, it gets
emotional, and it’s become passionate over a woman of the desert.
It asks things of me, and it keeps me from sleeping many nights,
when I’m thinking about her.”
“Well, that’s good. Your heart is alive. Keep listening to what it
has to say.”
During the next three days, the two travelers passed by a
number of armed tribesmen, and saw others on the horizon. The
boy’s heart began to speak of fear. It told him stories it had heard
from the Soul of the World, stories of men who sought to find their
treasure and never succeeded. Sometimes it frightened the boy with
the idea that he might not find his treasure, or that he might die
there in the desert. At other times, it told the boy that it was
satisfied: it had found love and riches.
“My heart is a traitor,” the boy said to the alchemist, when they
had paused to rest the horses. “It doesn’t want me to go on.”
“That makes sense,” the alchemist answered. “Naturally it’s
afraid that, in pursuing your dream, you might lose everything
you’ve won.”
“Well, then, why should I listen to my heart?”
“Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet. Even if
you pretend not to have heard what it tells you, it will always be
there inside you, repeating to you what you’re thinking about life
and about the world.”
“You mean I should listen, even if it’s treasonous?”
“Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly. If you know your
heart well, it will never be able to do that to you. Because you’ll
know its dreams and wishes, and will know how to deal with them.
“You will never be able to escape from your heart. So it’s better
to listen to what it has to say. That way, you’ll never have to fear an
unanticipated blow.”
The boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the
desert. He came to understand its dodges and tricks, and to accept it
as it was. He lost his fear, and forgot about his need to go back to the
oasis, because, one afternoon, his heart told him that it was happy.
“Even though I complain sometimes,” it said, “it’s because I’m the
heart of a person, and people’s hearts are that way. People are
afraid to pursue their most important dreams, because they feel
that they don’t deserve them, or that they’ll be unable to achieve
them. We, their hearts, become fearful just thinking of loved ones
who go away forever, or of moments that could have been good but
weren’t, or of treasures that might have been found but were
forever hidden in the sands. Because, when these things happen, we
suffer terribly.”
“My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer,” the boy told the
alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky.
“Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the
suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in
search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a
second’s encounter with God and with eternity.”
“Every second of the search is an encounter with God,” the boy
told his heart. “When I have been truly searching for my treasure,
every day has been luminous, because I’ve known that every hour
was a part of the dream that I would find it. When I have been truly
searching for my treasure, I’ve discovered things along the way that
I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that
seemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve.”
