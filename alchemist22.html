          The merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal
glasses. He was selling better than ever…as if time had turned back
to the old days when the street had been one of Tangier’s major
attractions.
“Business has really improved,” he said to the boy, after the
customer had left. “I’m doing much better, and soon you’ll be able to
return to your sheep. Why ask more out of life?”
“Because we have to respond to omens,” the boy said, almost
without meaning to; then he regretted what he had said, because
the merchant had never met the king.
“It’s called the principle of favorability, beginner’s luck. Because
life wants you to achieve your Personal Legend,” the old king had
said.
But the merchant understood what the boy had said. The boy’s
very presence in the shop was an omen, and, as time passed and
money was pouring into the cash drawer, he had no regrets about
having hired the boy. The boy was being paid more money than he
deserved, because the merchant, thinking that sales wouldn’t
amount to much, had offered the boy a high commission rate. He
had assumed he would soon return to his sheep.
“Why did you want to get to the Pyramids?” he asked, to get
away from the business of the display.
“Because I’ve always heard about them,” the boy answered,
saying nothing about his dream. The treasure was now nothing but
a painful memory, and he tried to avoid thinking about it.
“I don’t know anyone around here who would want to cross the
desert just to see the Pyramids,” said the merchant. “They’re just a
pile of stones. You could build one in your backyard.”
“You’ve never had dreams of travel,” said the boy, turning to
wait on a customer who had entered the shop.
Two days later, the merchant spoke to the boy about the display.
“I don’t much like change,” he said. “You and I aren’t like Hassan,
that rich merchant. If he makes a buying mistake, it doesn’t affect
him much. But we two have to live with our mistakes.”
That’s true enough, the boy thought, ruefully.
“Why did you think we should have the display?”
“I want to get back to my sheep faster. We have to take
advantage when luck is on our side, and do as much to help it as it’s
doing to help us. It’s called the principle of favorability. Or
beginner’s luck.”
The merchant was silent for a few moments. Then he said, “The
Prophet gave us the Koran, and left us just five obligations to satisfy
during our lives. The most important is to believe only in the one
true God. The others are to pray five times a day, fast during
Ramadan, and be charitable to the poor.”
He stopped there. His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the
Prophet. He was a devout man, and, even with all his impatience, he
wanted to live his life in accordance with Muslim law.
“What’s the fifth obligation?” the boy asked.
