            But she has the Sacred Heart of Jesus there, he thought, trying to
            reassure himself. He didn’t want his hand to begin trembling,
            showing the old woman that he was fearful. He recited an Our
            Father silently.
            “Very interesting,” said the woman, never taking her eyes from
            the boy’s hands, and then she fell silent.
            The boy was becoming nervous. His hands began to tremble, and
            the woman sensed it. He quickly pulled his hands away.
            “I didn’t come here to have you read my palm,” he said, already
            regretting having come. He thought for a moment that it would be
            better to pay her fee and leave without learning a thing, that he was
            giving too much importance to his recurrent dream.
            “You came so that you could learn about your dreams,” said the
            old woman. “And dreams are the language of God. When he speaks
            in our language, I can interpret what he has said. But if he speaks in
            the language of the soul, it is only you who can understand. But,
            whichever it is, I’m going to charge you for the consultation.”
            Another trick, the boy thought. But he decided to take a chance.
            A shepherd always takes his chances with wolves and with drought,
            and that’s what makes a shepherd’s life exciting.
            “I have had the same dream twice,” he said. “I dreamed that I
            was in a field with my sheep, when a child appeared and began to
            play with the animals. I don’t like people to do that, because the
            sheep are afraid of strangers. But children always seem to be able to
            play with them without frightening them. I don’t know why. I don’t
            know how animals know the age of human beings.”
            “Tell me more about your dream,” said the woman. “I have to get
            back to my cooking, and, since you don’t have much money, I can’t
            give you a lot of time.”
            “The child went on playing with my sheep for quite a while,”
            continued the boy, a bit upset. “And suddenly, the child took me by
            both hands and transported me to the Egyptian pyramids.”
            He paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the
            Egyptian pyramids were. But she said nothing.
            “Then, at the Egyptian pyramids,”—he said the last three words
            slowly, so that the old woman would understand—“the child said to
            me, ‘If you come here, you will find a hidden treasure.’ And, just as
            she was about to show me the exact location, I woke up. Both
            times.”
            The woman was silent for some time. Then she again took his
            hands and studied them carefully.
            “I’m not going to charge you anything now,” she said. “But I want
            one-tenth of the treasure, if you find it.”
            The boy laughed—out of happiness. He was going to be able to
            save the little money he had because of a dream about hidden
            treasure!
            “Well, interpret the dream,” he said.
            “First, swear to me. Swear that you will give me one-tenth of
            your treasure in exchange for what I am going to tell you.”
            The shepherd swore that he would. The old woman asked him to
            swear again while looking at the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.
            “It’s a dream in the language of the world,” she said. “I can
            interpret it, but the interpretation is very difficult. That’s why I feel
            that I deserve a part of what you find.
