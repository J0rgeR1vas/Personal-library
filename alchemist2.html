         The girl was typical of the region of Andalusia, with flowing
            black hair, and eyes that vaguely recalled the Moorish conquerors.
            “Well, usually I learn more from my sheep than from books,” he
            answered. During the two hours that they talked, she told him she
            was the merchant’s daughter, and spoke of life in the village, where
            each day was like all the others. The shepherd told her of the
            Andalusian countryside, and related the news from the other towns
            where he had stopped. It was a pleasant change from talking to his
            sheep.
            “How did you learn to read?” the girl asked at one point.
            “Like everybody learns,” he said. “In school.”
            “Well, if you know how to read, why are you just a shepherd?”
            The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid
            responding to her question. He was sure the girl would never
            understand. He went on telling stories about his travels, and her
            bright, Moorish eyes went wide with fear and surprise. As the time
            passed, the boy found himself wishing that the day would never
            end, that her father would stay busy and keep him waiting for three
            days. He recognized that he was feeling something he had never
            experienced before: the desire to live in one place forever. With the
            girl with the raven hair, his days would never be the same again.
            But finally the merchant appeared, and asked the boy to shear
            four sheep. He paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come
            back the following year.
            AND NOW IT WAS ONLY FOUR DAYS BEFORE HE WOULD BE back in that same
            village. He was excited, and at the same time uneasy: maybe the girl
            had already forgotten him. Lots of shepherds passed through,
            selling their wool.
            “It doesn’t matter,” he said to his sheep. “I know other girls in
            other places.”
            But in his heart he knew that it did matter. And he knew that
            shepherds, like seamen and like traveling salesmen, always found a
            town where there was someone who could make them forget the
            joys of carefree wandering.
            The day was dawning, and the shepherd urged his sheep in the
            direction of the sun. They never have to make any decisions, he
            thought. Maybe that’s why they always stay close to me.
            The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water.
            As long as the boy knew how to find the best pastures in Andalusia,
            they would be his friends. Yes, their days were all the same, with the
            seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk; and they had
            never read a book in their young lives, and didn’t understand when
            the boy told them about the sights of the cities. They were content
            with just food and water, and, in exchange, they generously gave of
            their wool, their company, and—once in a while—their meat.
            If I became a monster today, and decided to kill them, one by
            one, they would become aware only after most of the flock had been
            slaughtered, thought the boy. They trust me, and they’ve forgotten
            how to rely on their own instincts, because I lead them to
            nourishment.
