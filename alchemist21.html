          The merchant looked anxiously at the boy. All the joy he had
            seen that morning had suddenly disappeared.
            “I can give you the money you need to get back to your country,
            my son,” said the crystal merchant.
            The boy said nothing. He got up, adjusted his clothing, and
            picked up his pouch.
            “I’ll work for you,” he said.
            And after another long silence, he added, “I need money to buy
            some sheep.”

  Chapter 2


            THE BOY HAD BEEN WORKING FOR THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT for almost a
month, and he could see that it wasn’t exactly the kind of job that
would make him happy. The merchant spent the entire day
mumbling behind the counter, telling the boy to be careful with the
pieces and not to break anything.
         But he stayed with the job because the merchant, although he
was an old grouch, treated him fairly; the boy received a good
commission for each piece he sold, and had already been able to put
some money aside. That morning he had done some calculating: if
he continued to work every day as he had been, he would need a
whole year to be able to buy some sheep.
“I’d like to build a display case for the crystal,” the boy said to
the merchant. “We could place it outside, and attract those people
who pass at the bottom of the hill.”
“I’ve never had one before,” the merchant answered. “People
will pass by and bump into it, and pieces will be broken.”
“Well, when I took my sheep through the fields some of them
might have died if we had come upon a snake. But that’s the way life
is with sheep and with shepherds.”
