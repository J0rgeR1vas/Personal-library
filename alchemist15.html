           But he didn’t need to worry about that right now. What he had
            to be concerned about was his treasure, and how he was going to go
            about getting it. The sale of his sheep had left him with enough
            money in his pouch, and the boy knew that in money there was
            magic; whoever has money is never really alone. Before long, maybe
            in just a few days, he would be at the Pyramids. An old man, with a
            breastplate of gold, wouldn’t have lied just to acquire six sheep.
            The old man had spoken about signs and omens, and, as the boy
            was crossing the strait, he had thought about omens. Yes, the old
            man had known what he was talking about: during the time the boy
            had spent in the fields of Andalusia, he had become used to learning
            which path he should take by observing the ground and the sky. He
            had discovered that the presence of a certain bird meant that a
            snake was nearby, and that a certain shrub was a sign that there
            was water in the area. The sheep had taught him that.
            If God leads the sheep so well, he will also lead a man, he
            thought, and that made him feel better. The tea seemed less bitter.
            “Who are you?” he heard a voice ask him in Spanish.
            The boy was relieved. He was thinking about omens, and
            someone had appeared.
            “How come you speak Spanish?” he asked. The new arrival was a
            young man in Western dress, but the color of his skin suggested he
            was from this city. He was about the same age and height as the boy.
            “Almost everyone here speaks Spanish. We’re only two hours
            from Spain.”
            “Sit down, and let me treat you to something,” said the boy. “And
            ask for a glass of wine for me. I hate this tea.”
            “There is no wine in this country,” the young man said. “The
            religion here forbids it.”
            The boy told him then that he needed to get to the Pyramids. He
            almost began to tell about his treasure, but decided not to do so. If
            he did, it was possible that the Arab would want a part of it as
            payment for taking him there. He remembered what the old man
            had said about offering something you didn’t even have yet.
            “I’d like you to take me there if you can. I can pay you to serve as
            my guide.”
            “Do you have any idea how to get there?” the newcomer asked.
            The boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby,
            listening attentively to their conversation. He felt uneasy at the
            man’s presence. But he had found a guide, and didn’t want to miss
            out on an opportunity.
            “You have to cross the entire Sahara desert,” said the young man.
            “And to do that, you need money. I need to know whether you have
            enough.”
            The boy thought it a strange question. But he trusted in the old
            man, who had said that, when you really want something, the
            universe always conspires in your favor.
            He took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young
            man. The owner of the bar came over and looked, as well. The two
            men exchanged some words in Arabic, and the bar owner seemed
            irritated.
            “Let’s get out of here,” said the new arrival. “He wants us to
            leave.”
