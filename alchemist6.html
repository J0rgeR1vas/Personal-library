          “And this is my interpretation: you must go to the Pyramids in
            Egypt. I have never heard of them, but, if it was a child who showed
            them to you, they exist. There you will find a treasure that will make
            you a rich man.”
            The boy was surprised, and then irritated. He didn’t need to seek
            out the old woman for this! But then he remembered that he wasn’t
            going to have to pay anything.
            “I didn’t need to waste my time just for this,” he said.
            “I told you that your dream was a difficult one. It’s the simple
            things in life that are the most extraordinary; only wise men are
            able to understand them. And since I am not wise, I have had to
            learn other arts, such as the reading of palms.”
            “Well, how am I going to get to Egypt?”
            “I only interpret dreams. I don’t know how to turn them into
            reality. That’s why I have to live off what my daughters provide me
            with.”
            “And what if I never get to Egypt?”
            “Then I don’t get paid. It wouldn’t be the first time.”
            And the woman told the boy to leave, saying she had already
            wasted too much time with him.<!---->
            So the boy was disappointed; he decided that he would never
            again believe in dreams. He remembered that he had a number of
            things he had to take care of: he went to the market for something
            to eat, he traded his book for one that was thicker, and he found a
            bench in the plaza where he could sample the new wine he had
            bought. The day was hot, and the wine was refreshing. The sheep
            were at the gates of the city, in a stable that belonged to a friend.
            The boy knew a lot of people in the city. That was what made
            traveling appeal to him—he always made new friends, and he didn’t
            need to spend all of his time with them. When someone sees the
            same people every day, as had happened with him at the seminary,
            they wind up becoming a part of that person’s life. And then they
            want the person to change. If someone isn’t what others want them
            to be, the others become angry. Everyone seems to have a clear idea
            of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or
            her own.
            He decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky
            before following his flock back through the fields. Three days from
            now, he would be with the merchant’s daughter.
            He started to read the book he had bought. On the very first page
            it described a burial ceremony. And the names of the people
            involved were very difficult to pronounce. If he ever wrote a book,
            he thought, he would present one person at a time, so that the
            reader wouldn’t have to worry about memorizing a lot of names.
            When he was finally able to concentrate on what he was reading,
            he liked the book better; the burial was on a snowy day, and he
            welcomed the feeling of being cold. As he read on, an old man sat
            down at his side and tried to strike up a conversation.
            “What are they doing?” the old man asked, pointing at the people
            in the plaza.
