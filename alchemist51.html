         So his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon. That night, the
boy slept deeply, and, when he awoke, his heart began to tell him
things that came from the Soul of the World. It said that all people
who are happy have God within them. And that happiness could be
found in a grain of sand from the desert, as the alchemist had said.
Because a grain of sand is a moment of creation, and the universe
has taken millions of years to create it. “Everyone on earth has a
treasure that awaits him,” his heart said. “We, people’s hearts,
seldom say much about those treasures, because people no longer
want to go in search of them. We speak of them only to children.
Later, we simply let life proceed, in its own direction, toward its
own fate. But, unfortunately, very few follow the path laid out for
them—the path to their Personal Legends, and to happiness. Most
people see the world as a threatening place, and, because they do,
the world turns out, indeed, to be a threatening place.
“So, we, their hearts, speak more and more softly. We never stop
speaking out, but we begin to hope that our words won’t be heard:
we don’t want people to suffer because they don’t follow their
hearts.”
“Why don’t people’s hearts tell them to continue to follow their
dreams?” the boy asked the alchemist.
“Because that’s what makes a heart suffer most, and hearts don’t
like to suffer.”
From then on, the boy understood his heart. He asked it, please,
never to stop speaking to him. He asked that, when he wandered far
from his dreams, his heart press him and sound the alarm. The boy
swore that, every time he heard the alarm, he would heed its
message.
That night, he told all of this to the alchemist. And the alchemist
understood that the boy’s heart had returned to the Soul of the
World.
“So what should I do now?” the boy asked.
“Continue in the direction of the Pyramids,” said the alchemist.
“And continue to pay heed to the omens. Your heart is still capable
of showing you where the treasure is.”
“Is that the one thing I still needed to know?”
“No,” the alchemist answered. “What you still need to know is
this: before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests
everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because
it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams,
master the lessons we’ve learned as we’ve moved toward that
dream. That’s the point at which most people give up. It’s the point
at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one ‘dies of thirst
just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon.’
“Every search begins with beginner’s luck. And every search
ends with the victor’s being severely tested.”
The boy remembered an old proverb from his country. It said
that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn.
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY, THE FIRST CLEAR SIGN OF danger appeared.
Three armed tribesmen approached, and asked what the boy and
the alchemist were doing there.
“I’m hunting with my falcon,” the alchemist answered.
“We’re going to have to search you to see whether you’re
armed,” one of the tribesmen said.
The alchemist dismounted slowly, and the boy did the same.
“Why are you carrying money?” asked the tribesman, when he
had searched the boy’s bag.
“I need it to get to the Pyramids,” he said.
The tribesman who was searching the alchemist’s belongings
found a small crystal flask filled with a liquid, and a yellow glass egg
that was slightly larger than a chicken’s egg.
“What are these things?” he asked.
“That’s the Philosopher’s Stone and the Elixir of Life. It’s the
Master Work of the alchemists. Whoever swallows that elixir will
never be sick again, and a fragment from that stone turns any metal
into gold.”
