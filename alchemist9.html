          “For several reasons. But let’s say that the most important is that
            you have succeeded in discovering your Personal Legend.”
            The boy didn’t know what a person’s “Personal Legend” was.
            “It’s what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone,
            when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is.
            “At that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is
            possible. They are not afraid to dream, and to yearn for everything
            they would like to see happen to them in their lives. But, as time
            passes, a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be
            impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend.”
            None of what the old man was saying made much sense to the
            boy. But he wanted to know what the “mysterious force” was; the
            merchant’s daughter would be impressed when he told her about
            that!
            “It’s a force that appears to be negative, but actually shows you
            how to realize your Personal Legend. It prepares your spirit and
            your will, because there is one great truth on this planet: whoever
            you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want
            something, it’s because that desire originated in the soul of the
            universe. It’s your mission on earth.”
            “Even when all you want to do is travel? Or marry the daughter
            of a textile merchant?”
            “Yes, or even search for treasure. The Soul of the World is
            nourished by people’s happiness. And also by unhappiness, envy,
            and jealousy. To realize one’s Personal Legend is a person’s only
            real obligation. All things are one.
            “And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in
            helping you to achieve it.”
            They were both silent for a time, observing the plaza and the
            townspeople. It was the old man who spoke first.
            “Why do you tend a flock of sheep?”
            “Because I like to travel.”
            The old man pointed to a baker standing in his shop window at
            one corner of the plaza. “When he was a child, that man wanted to
            travel, too. But he decided first to buy his bakery and put some
            money aside. When he’s an old man, he’s going to spend a month in
            Africa. He never realized that people are capable, at any time in
            their lives, of doing what they dream of.”
            “He should have decided to become a shepherd,” the boy said.
            “Well, he thought about that,” the old man said. “But bakers are
            more important people than shepherds. Bakers have homes, while
            shepherds sleep out in the open. Parents would rather see their
            children marry bakers than shepherds.”
            The boy felt a pang in his heart, thinking about the merchant’s
            daughter. There was surely a baker in her town.
            The old man continued, “In the long run, what people think
            about shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them
            than their own Personal Legends.”
            The old man leafed through the book, and fell to reading a page
            he came to. The boy waited, and then interrupted the old man just
            as he himself had been interrupted. “Why are you telling me all
            this?”
