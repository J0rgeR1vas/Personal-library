      The boy closed his book. He felt that he didn’t want to do
      anything that might make him look like the Englishman. He took
      Urim and Thummim from his pocket, and began playing with them.
      The stranger shouted, “Urim and Thummim!”
      In a flash the boy put them back in his pocket.
      “They’re not for sale,” he said.
      “They’re not worth much,” the Englishman answered. “They’re
      only made of rock crystal, and there are millions of rock crystals in
      the earth. But those who know about such things would know that
      those are Urim and Thummim. I didn’t know that they had them in
      this part of the world.”
      “They were given to me as a present by a king,” the boy said.
      The stranger didn’t answer; instead, he put his hand in his
      pocket, and took out two stones that were the same as the boy’s.
      “Did you say a king?” he asked.
      “I guess you don’t believe that a king would talk to someone like
      me, a shepherd,” he said, wanting to end the conversation.
      “Not at all. It was shepherds who were the first to recognize a
      king that the rest of the world refused to acknowledge. So, it’s not
      surprising that kings would talk to shepherds.”
      And he went on, fearing that the boy wouldn’t understand what
      he was talking about, “It’s in the Bible. The same book that taught
      me about Urim and Thummim. These stones were the only form of
      divination permitted by God. The priests carried them in a golden
      breastplate.”
      The boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse.
      “Maybe this is an omen,” said the Englishman, half aloud.
      “Who told you about omens?” The boy’s interest was increasing
      by the moment.
      “Everything in life is an omen,” said the Englishman, now closing
      the journal he was reading. “There is a universal language,
      understood by everybody, but already forgotten. I am in search of
      that universal language, among other things. That’s why I’m here. I
      have to find a man who knows that universal language. An
      alchemist.”
      The conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss.
      “You’re in luck, you two,” the fat Arab said. “There’s a caravan
      leaving today for Al-Fayoum.”
      “But I’m going to Egypt,” the boy said.
      “Al-Fayoum is in Egypt,” said the Arab. “What kind of Arab are
      you?”
      “That’s a good luck omen,” the Englishman said, after the fat
      Arab had gone out. “If I could, I’d write a huge encyclopedia just
      about the words luck and coincidence. It’s with those words that the
      universal language is written.”
      He told the boy it was no coincidence that he had met him with
      Urim and Thummim in his hand. And he asked the boy if he, too,
      were in search of the alchemist.
      “I’m looking for a treasure,” said the boy, and he immediately
      regretted having said it. But the Englishman appeared not to attach
      any importance to it.
      “In a way, so am I,” he said.
      “I don’t even know what alchemy is,” the boy was saying, when
      the warehouse boss called to them to come outside.
      “I’M THE LEADER OF THE CARAVAN,” SAID A DARK-EYED, bearded man. “I
      hold the power of life and death for every person I take with me.
      The desert is a capricious lady, and sometimes she drives men
      crazy.”
